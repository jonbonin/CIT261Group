            Arrays are very helpful.
            The help you store a lot of items in one variable.
            The particular category that I have used is fruit.
            As you will see, I have stored a few different types of fruit within one variable fruit. 
            (Bit redundant, but helps you remember what the variable is for.)
        </p>
        <p>
            The are a few different things that you can do with arrays.
            You can add and take away items at the end and beginning of arrays.
            These are called pushing, popping, shift, and unshift. 
            I will go over these in more detail.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                fruit.pop();
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This adds one or more items onto the array.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                fruit.push();
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This takes away one item at a time from the end of the array
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                fruit.unshift();
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This adds multiple items to the beginning of an array
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                fruit.shift();
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This takes away the first item in the array.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                fruit.splice(2, 0, "mango", "cat");
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This function as a few different notes to it. The next two bullet points are required, the third is optional.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The 2 is the position. In other words you are telling the function where to put the values within the array.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The 0 is telling how many items to delete. There two examples that I have, one adds and doesn't delete, the other deletes, and doesn't add.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For the function to work this is not required. 
                        When you add something (like in my example) you can specify what you want to go into the array at the defined position.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I would note two things here.
            This will help you remember which one does what.
            First, the push pushes the last one item away, therfore deleting it from the array.
            Secondly, the shift and unshift are backwards. The unshift adds to the beginning of an array.
            To remember which item goes at which end of the array, that is for you to decide.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is the code that I used to illustrate using arrays.
            Don't forgot to open the console(right click then inspect) to view the results to these sets of code.<br>
            <strong>Note:</strong> I used self declaring functions for these examples.
            This is done with the extra parenthesis that are outside the function.
        </p>
