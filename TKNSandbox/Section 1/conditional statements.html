<h2>Nasty Paths</h2>
	
	<li>Putting a semi-colon at the end of an if statement</li>
	<!--if (money < 3);-->
	
	<li>Incorrect comparison operator</li>
	<!--if (age < 21)
{
	document.write("Oh great you obviously old enough to serve alcohol to!");
}-->

	<li>Messing up the syntax of the 'else if' statement</li>
	<!--if else (happy_Index > 3)-->
	
	<li>Putting the conditional statements out of order</li>
	<!--if (happy_Index > 7)
{
	document.write("Wow! Awesome! I am glad to hear that.");
}

else
{
	document.write("Okay then. What seems to be bothering you?");
}

else if (happy_Index > 3)
{
	document.write("Good. Everything thing seems to be alright then.");
}-->
	
	<li>Using the wrong case in a switch statement</li>
	<!--var month = prompt("What was the number of the month you were born in?");
var input = parseInt(month);
switch (input) {
    case oranges:
        birthday = "January";

        birthday = "February";
		document.write("Nice. You were born in " + birthday + ".");
        break;
    case 3:   .....-->
	
	<li>Forgetting to include a break after your code has been executed in a block statement</li>
	<!--var month = prompt("What was the number of the month you were born in?");
var input = parseInt(month);
switch (input) {
    case 1:

    case 2:
        birthday = "February";
		document.write("Nice. You were born in " + birthday + ".");
    case 3:   .......-->
	
	<li>Adding a break statement under the deftault statement</li>
	<!--default:
		document.write("Invalid input");
		break;
}-->
	
	<li>Making sure to have the right input for your conditional</li>
	<!--var money = prompt ("How much money do you have?");
		var cars = 5;
if (cars < 3)
{
	document.write("No icecream for you!");
}-->	
	
	<li>Forgetting to have your default statement</li>
	<!--case 13:
		document.write("Invalid input");
}
